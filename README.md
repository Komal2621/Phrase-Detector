Phrase Detector using LSTM – Project Summary

This project implements a Phrase Detector using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), designed to predict the next word or phrase in a sequence based on learned context. 


Key Components:

Data Preprocessing: Text is cleaned, tokenized, and converted into input-output sequences for training.

Model Architecture: Multiple LSTM layers followed by a dense output layer process sequences and predict the next likely word/phrase.

Training: The model learns from sequential data using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize prediction error.

Evaluation: Accuracy, loss, and perplexity are used to assess model performance.

Prediction System: The trained model suggests likely phrase completions for partial inputs, mimicking predictive typing.


Conclusion:
The Phrase Detector leverages LSTM’s strength in handling sequential data, enabling context-aware text prediction. Such models have wide applications in writing tools, chat systems, and digital assistants.
